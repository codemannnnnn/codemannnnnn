## Hello :grinning:

I'm Cody. I'm a software engineer focused on Full Stack Web Development. I love building web apps that help solve problems, assist in making peoples lives easier and very excited to build software that will help keep people safe. I attended Lambda School in an online capacity and have received my endorsement certification. I have been running my own small business in the IT and web development ecosystem for 3 years now and have loved the challenges that come with it.
